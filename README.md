Odin Project build

First commit - working but not removing 16x16 (original) grid after prompt. 
It is adding the new grid below the original grid. Still much to do with CSS

second commit - removing previous tile number is now working. 
Still need to do the optional "random color" aspect of project
and of course styling still needs done.

3rd commit - functionality is spread across 3 index.html files. I now need to build a buttun selection and combine these index files into one so the user can select if they want "black" "color" or "psych."
